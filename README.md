# HoI IV DLC unlcoker mod 
This mod just removes all DLC checks from game files. Simple as that. Wherever it finds `has_dlc = "whatever"`, it becomes `always = yes`. Don't worry if you don't get the cool loading screens, everything still works when you enter.

Obviously not Ironman compatible. duh.

# Installlation
Well it's a regular mod, so you just have to download it and extract it to your hoi4 folder.

linux: `~/.local/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mods`

windows: `C:/users/{your username}/My Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mods`

Just extract this archive into your mod folder, and make a new file in mods called... anything you want really. It just has to end in `.mod` and not have any spaces.

example:

`DLC_unlocker.mod`
```version="1.0"
tags={
	"Events"
	"Fixes"
	"Military"
	"National Focuses"
	"Technologies"
	"Gameplay"
}
name="HoI IV DLC"
supported_version="1.10.8"
path="* path to the folder you extracted*"
```


# Problems

It's not perfect, so some DLC features don't work.
For example the intelligence tab doesn't work. Neither does the ship design screen. Only things like focuses and resistance work. Your results may vary. If you really need those features, I recommend waiting until a sale to buy the DLCs, or just use a russian or venezuelan VPN to buy them at like a tenth of the price. Last january the base game was 150 roubles, which is like 2 dollars. But you need to have a local payment method from there so maybe go on vacation to Moscow and then buy it?

Just keep in mind not everything works, but if at least you can practice in singleplayer. When No Step Back comes out I will probbably update this repo. If I do, I wil notify everyone in the discord. Also check out the TNO submod I'm working on called Thousand Year Dream (TYD).
